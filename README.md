## This game is intro to 3D painting app where I have done the following functionality features in the first features I created two of my own prefabs. One prefab with a single object and the other two prefabs with multiple objects. I animated each prefab and their child objects. I have an Update UI that allows the user to select one of three objects to spawn, and one of three animations to play on those objects. Also, Update UI to allow the user to change the speed of the animations, and allows the user to randomize the type of animation and its speed. Moreover, I have been able to create a quad as the background for my UI elements and align them so they match up properly. I also have created one more material that I have used to create my new prefabs object.
